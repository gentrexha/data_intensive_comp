It is a fantastic reference for plank grilling - in fact, i would say it is 'THE BEST' reference for planking. It is, and I'm not joking, a seriously fun read. It would even make a great coffee table book for great the food shots are.For our review we did a step by step review of the Original Planked Salmon recipe. Out of the gate I took a little liberty with the ingredients on the toppings and it was immediately a favorite. So much so that we've done the recipe again and again. For a professional BBQ Chef, that is definitely saying something. It is also worth mentioning that the rub he uses here is bottled and sold commercially.One of the reasons that I like this book so much is that i covers the entire pantheon of techniques for plank and wood grilling. There are great ideas and approaches to making your own (and much better) planks than what you can buy in the store. The Holy Plank is a great way to grill foods and the rack for skewers is great if you have the room. I've enjoyed this cookbook and my interactions with Teddy. This cookbook is one of my favorites and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to plank grill.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "TipsforBBQ.com Recommends It", "unixReviewTime": 1363737600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2013", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}
